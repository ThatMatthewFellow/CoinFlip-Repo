# CoinFlip - ThatMatthewFellow
Here's a simple project. A coin flip that generates a random number between 1 and 1,000,000 and depending on if it's higher or lower than 500,000, it will either decide on heads or tails
It also allows the user to flip as many coins as they want, and requires an input to either flip a coin or not flip a coin.
